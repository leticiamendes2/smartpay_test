# smartpay_test

Here you will find my coding solution + tests + mental notes for the Task #1 "UI - Card Entry Screen".

- Test reports: tests_results/
- Personal Notes: readme/

Scope:

- 1 UI with 7 input text fields and 1 button.
- When the app opens, this screen will be shown, and the user will be able to select any field to start typing.
- The button will be disabled by default and it only becomes enable when all the fields are correctly validated.
	- The mandatory fields have to be filled with valid information.
	- The validation will happen when the user removes the focus from the view.
- Once the user clicks on the "Continue" button, a toaster will display the message "Information Received".

Criteria:

Project Completeness (how much of the original specification was successfully delivered)

Development Experience (how easy your solution is to understand, extend, and maintain)
- How easy your solution is to Understand?
- How easy your solution is to Extend?
- How easy your solution is to Maintain?

Software Engineering (what your keys choices/decisions of software design, quality and performance were)
- What your keys choices/decisions of software design?
- What your keys choices/decisions of software quality?
- What your keys choices/decisions of software performance?

Outputs:

Links to your technical solution, so that we can look at your code and its history. 
The solution should contain at minimum:
- The code for the program (project and Gradle files included)
- The code for unit tests (with instructions on how to run them)
- The code for acceptance tests (with instructions on how to run them)
